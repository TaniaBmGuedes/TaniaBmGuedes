## 🧠 Exploring AI & Machine Learning

Although I’m still at the beginning of my journey with **Artificial Intelligence**, I’m actively studying and experimenting with:

- Neural networks & deep learning fundamentals  
- Data preprocessing and model evaluation  
- LLMs (Large Language Models) and modern AI tools  
- Applying AI to personal projects and experiments  

No dedicated ML/AI projects yet — but they are coming soon!  
I'm currently preparing small experiments and prototypes that will eventually turn into real projects. 🔥

## 🧠 Exploring AI & Machine Learning

Although I’m still at the beginning of my journey with **Artificial Intelligence**, I’m actively studying and experimenting with:

- 🧬 Neural networks & deep learning fundamentals  
- 📊 Data preprocessing and model evaluation  
- 🧠 LLMs (Large Language Models) and modern AI tools  
- 🚀 Applying AI to personal projects and experiments  

No dedicated ML/AI projects yet — but they are coming soon!  
I'm currently preparing small experiments and prototypes that will eventually turn into real projects. 🔥

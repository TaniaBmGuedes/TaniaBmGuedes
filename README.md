# 👋 Hi, I'm Tania Guedes

I'm a passionate **Software Developer** with a background in Informatics Engineering.  
I enjoy building clean, functional, and well-structured applications — especially for the web. ✨

- Full-stack & front-end development  
- Growing interest in **AI, Machine Learning & automation**  
- Tools & technologies: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React, Next.js  
- Always learning and exploring new stacks, patterns, and modern development practices

## 🧠 Exploring AI & Machine Learning

Although I’m still at the beginning of my journey with **Artificial Intelligence**, I’m actively studying and experimenting with:

- Neural networks & deep learning fundamentals  
- Data preprocessing and model evaluation  
- LLMs (Large Language Models) and modern AI tools  
- Applying AI to personal projects and experiments  

No dedicated ML/AI projects yet — but they are coming soon!  
I'm currently preparing small experiments and prototypes that will eventually turn into real projects. 🔥
